/**
The brute force way to do this would be to just rescan the tree looking for changes, but I'm looking for a more "interrupt driven" solution where the file system tells my code what changed when it changes, rather than my code having to "poll" by continuously scanning through thousands of files looking for changes.

some good thought to take:
    eventIO : actor callback
    file system change : select poll epoll
    httprequest listener : tomcat
